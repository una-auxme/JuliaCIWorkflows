The Julia-Formatter-action checks pullrequests for beeing formatted according to the julia coding standards.

In order to format all files in a package, in a REPL in the package root, call:
]add JuliaFormatter
using JuliaFormatter
format(".")

you meight have to call format(".") multiple times, until it returns true.
Preferably do that on all files, you change before adding them to a PR.

Pitfalls: 
If there are .jl files, that contain non-parseable content, JuliaFormatter could crash. 
In order to exclude those .jl files from the format checks, add a file named ".JuliaFormatter.toml" with the content "ignore = ["*.jl"]" to the folder of the .jl files
