As per the julia specs, the tests must be located at <package-root>/test/runtests.jl

To include it into another repository, just paste the TestLTS.yml into .github/workflows. If you also want testing against Julias latest version, also have a look at TestLatest.yml

If you want to optain a visual badge of the success-status on the workflow, eg. to include it in the documentation, you could do so from
